# Crop-Connect
Crop Connect lets users buy directly from local farmers. Users update their grocery list, search for farmers with the desired foods, and see inventory and distance. They can chat with farmers to negotiate prices and pick-up locations, making grocery shopping accessible and encouraging local purchases.
